- 2014-04-10/13:22/SkypeMessenger: Hey Chloe! [KeyName: Enter]
- 2014-04-10/13:25/SkypeMessenger: Of course I'm still at work. What else would I be doing? Having a life? LOL. [KeyName: Enter]
- 2014-04-10/13:26/SkypeMessenger: Anyway, Juliana says she's too busy to go drinking with us tonight. She had an argument with one of my co-workers the other day and I think she's still fill(←BS) ing papers to get him removed.[KeyName: Enter]
- 2014-04-10/13:28/SkypeMessenger: No idea what that lady is up to. Talk about a busy body. She looks sweet but she's frighteningly intense sometimes. Anyway, call me in five? They want to update the password again. [KeyName: Enter]
- 2014-04-10/13:29/SkypeMessenger: Don't get me started. Blackmoore uses the dog's name in all his passwords. Maybe I'll change the vowels in the name to a 1 and a 0 to at least pretend it's more secure.[KeyName: Enter]
- 2014-04-10/13:35/SkypeMessenger: brb, let me disconnect from the network before updating the password. Safety first, kids ;) [KeyName: Enter]
