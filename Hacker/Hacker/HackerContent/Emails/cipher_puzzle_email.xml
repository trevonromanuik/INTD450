Blackmoore has been working with a particular company to produce parts for his quantum mindshare device. I won’t tell you which company it is – that’s part of the game! Their products are being used at Blackmoore Industries in order to advance quantum science for the mindshare device. A paper was recently published about this work. Fascinating read! Take a look at it here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4848v1

I have one clue for you! It reminds me of something I heard once... Horses have hindlegs. They also have forelegs, which makes six legs. Now, six is an odd number of legs for a horse to have. Six is also an even number. And the only number that is both odd and even is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of legs. Wait, what was I rambling about? Oh yes, six! The company I’m thinking of produced the SIXTH COMPONENT of the device mentioned in this paper.

Report back to me when you’ve found the FIVE-DIGIT STREET ADDRESS of this company. Let’s see how honed your cyber-sleuthing skills really are.
