We recently confirmed that Ryan Blackmoore is involved in suspicious activities, with plans to distribute some
sort of mindshare device in the near future. He made the mistake of branding our little hacktivist organization
“internet nazis” after we publicized his secret money-laundering scheme in 2013. He's used other immature,
overused insults to garner public sympathy, going so far as to label us “primitive technocrats” and claim that
we are “armpit hair clogging the drain of progress.”

We intend to end Blackmoore's plot. Of course, this will only be possible with solid evidence of his guilt. That's
where you come in. Blackmoore is currently hosting an event at his exclusive online yacht, the SS Touch Tonic. Go
there and see what you can find out. You'll need to do some investigative work to find out where he stores his files.
