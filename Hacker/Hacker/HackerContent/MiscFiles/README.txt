   So, you're sick of the walled garden GlobeComm has to offer and you're
   ready to have some REAL fun. Sounds great. And it looks like you're being
   a good noob and you're going to RTFM. Congratulations. Points for you.

   Feel free to make sure you get all the way to the end, too, cowboy.

 [1] How do I use this thing?
 [2] Command list
     (a) Arp - Get to know your neighbours
     (b) Spoof - Copy cat your neighbours
	 (c) Keylog - Snoop on your neighbours
 [3] Play safe, use protection

    See that key right below the escape key? The one that looks like a squiggle (~)? Well, that's called a tilde. You use that key to open up the console from which all of the magic happens.
    
    Now, here's something that may cause your head to spin: you actually have to type in what you want to do. Crazy, right? No pretty buttons or menus here. Either learn how to use a command line, or GTFO.

===============================================================================
[2]  How do I use this thing?
===============================================================================
    This is the main event, here. Each command does something specific and, often, against the terms of service GlobeComm sets out. Basically, if you screw up and get caught using these, it's not my fault. Capiche?
    
    Anyway, next to the command name, there's an example of how to use it. If you see something in angle brackets - <like this> - that means that the command expects you to provide it information after the command name. An IP address or something.
    
    *****************************************************************************
    (a)  ARP => you type "arp"
    *****************************************************************************
      This command broadcasts a request to all the people you've recently talked to, asking for their IP address. What's an IP address, you ponder? Well, that's a little string of numbers that tells everyone online WHO are and WHERE you come from.
	  
	  Grabbing this info from everyone is definitely not GlobeComm approved, but screw 'em.
    
    *****************************************************************************
    (b)  Spoof => you type "spoof <IP>"
    *****************************************************************************
      Once you have some sucker's IP address, you can pretend to be them. When communicating with other people, you use your victim's IP address as your own, so everyone else thinks that YOU are THEM!
    
      Bitchin', right?
	  
	*****************************************************************************
    (c)  Keylog => you type "keylog <IP>"
    *****************************************************************************
      A cool thing about GlobeComm - and also its weakness - is that people like to use it while they also do other things. Email their bosses, Skype with their grandma, check their bank account... If you can see what someone's typing, you can learn a lot about a person.
	  
	  Once you've got someone's IP address with ARP, you can stick a keylogger on 'em. After a moment, look on your desktop for 'GlobeComm Deliveries/keylogs', and whatever that person was typing will show up there!
    
      Now if that ain't illegal, I don't know what is.

[3]  Play safe, use protection
===============================================================================
	You use these tools at your own risk, friend! Don't tell nobody you know how to do these things. I heard that going to prison for cyber crimes is pretty nasty. Stories about torture involving a cactus...and a croquet mallet.... Gives me the jibblies! 
	
	The only way to protect yourself is really to try to stay obscure. Don't go plastering your pretty mug all over the interwebs, and do go tellin' strangers your mailing address, or the feds will come knockin'. And trust me, they won't be selling girl scout cookies. Try not to shake a hornet's nest, know what I mean? Sure you do.
	
	Happy hacking, chum!
